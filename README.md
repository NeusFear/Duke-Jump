# Duke-Jump

This is an entry into the Together Java 02/2026 Game Jam

It is written entireley in Java, and uses my own game engine TerminalVelocityEngine2. I have never made a game with my engine, so I'm taking this opportunity to create something simple. The basic idea is to re-create the google no connection game, but with duke and java programming related themes. If all things go well I'll add some other features besides just those found in the google game, but we will see.
