# Duke-Jump

This is an entry into the Together Java 02/2026 Game Jam

It is written entireley in Java, and uses my own game engine TerminalVelocityEngine2. I have never made a game with my engine, so I'm taking this opportunity to create something simple. The basic idea is to re-create the google no connection game, but with duke and java programming related themes. If all things go well I'll add some other features besides just those found in the google game, but we will see.

Features:
- [x] Jump to help Duke dodge bugs
- [x] Keep score of how many bugs you've avoided
- [x] Animated Duke and Bug Walking
- [x] Flying Bugs that you need to jump over or duck under (depending on height)
- [x] Bonus points for jumping on (and squashing) bugs
- [ ] Sounds/Animations for milestones
- [x] High Scores
- [ ] Music
- [ ] Power ups (like a jetpack and laser gun or something idk)
- [x] Main menu
- [ ] Pause the game
- [x] retry (instead of having to restart the game every time)
- [x] Add backspace to text input
- [x] Allow pressing enter to submit high score
- [ ] A simple tutorial to teach new players the controls and objective
